App fetches the top chart from itunes. Max range of chart provided by the API varies, 80-90 in my experience. You can chose a range to view and further filter the results by the genres present in that range. Easily extensible to filter by other criteria, although it might need seperate filter functions depending on the criteria, the way the API provides the information is somewhat inconsistent in terms of how the data is nested within the objects.

No additional packages required to run it beyond what comes as standard. From the terminal just run npm start once you havigate to the directory where you've cloned the repo, should run on localhost:3000
